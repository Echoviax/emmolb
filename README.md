# EMMOLB
**EMMOLB** is an alternative front-end for [MMOLB](https://mmolb.com), an online baseball simulator.  
We started this project because there were a few features and stats we wanted to see that weren't displayed on the official site's UI, so we copied their UI over and built on it using the public MMOLB API.  
## Features
- Score Box View
- Color Themes
- Custom Leagues
- Watch Multiple Games Live
- A Live Game-like Viewer
- Team Attributes all-in-one
- A lot more! We still make frequent updates
## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated!  
If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork and open pull requests! Our official discussion channel is in [the MMOLB Discord](https://discord.gg/cr3tRG2xqq), and more specifically [here](https://discord.com/channels/1136709081319604324/1366515448375541953).  
## Design Philosophy
Our design philosophy centers on:
- **Toggleability** - most features can be turned on or off, so folks can use EMMOLB while still keeping the look and feel of the original MMOLB site if they prefer.  
- **Light API usage** - we aim to use the MMOLB API responsibly, so that we don't overload the MMOLB servers with API requests.
