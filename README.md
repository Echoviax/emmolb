# EMMOLB
**EMMOLB** is an alternative front-end for [MMOLB](https://mmolb.com), an online baseball simulator.  
We started this project because there were a few features and stats we wanted to see that weren't displayed on the official site's UI, so we copied their UI over and built on it using the public MMOLB API.  
## Features
- Score Box View
- Color Themes
- Custom Leagues
- Watch Multiple Games Live
- A Live Game-like Viewer
- Team Attributes all-in-one
- A lot more! We still make frequent updates
