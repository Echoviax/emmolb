                        EMMOLB is a third-party viewing client for the website <Link href='https://mmolb.com' className="text-theme-secondary font-bold">MMOLB</Link>.<br></br>
                        If you don't know what MMOLB is and found your way here? That's pretty impressive actually. I don't think any of us would expect this page to get popular enough for that.

                        With that being said, if you don't know what <Link href='https://mmolb.com' className="text-theme-secondary font-bold">MMOLB</Link> is, we would highly recommend 
                        using the official site to create a team, and then maybe come back here once you have a grasp on <Link href='https://mmolb.com' className="text-theme-secondary font-bold">MMOLB</Link> basics.

                        This site was made as there were a few changes we wanted to see on the main site, but obviously we can't just change things, so we made a new site that uses the official API to pull data live. 
                        This way we can make whatever visual changes we want to make to the site, all while preserving the original and official data.
